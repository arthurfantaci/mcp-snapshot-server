00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
John Smith (Customer): Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm John Smith, CTO at Acme Corporation.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): Thanks for having us, John. I'm Sarah Jameson, and this is Charles Michaels, our Solutions Architect. We're excited to learn more about your infrastructure challenges.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:45.000
John Smith (Customer): Great. So we're currently running about 200 servers on-premise, mix of Windows and Linux environments. We're looking at cloud migration options primarily for cost optimization and disaster recovery.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): That's a substantial infrastructure. What's driving the urgency for migration? Are you experiencing specific pain points with your current setup?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:25.000
John Smith (Customer): We've had some downtime issues lately. Last month we had a 6-hour outage that cost us significantly. Our disaster recovery is basically non-existent right now, and we're projecting 50% growth next year.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): I can definitely understand the concern. Six hours of downtime is substantial. What's your current RTO and RPO requirements, and how much are you looking to improve those?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:55.000
John Smith (Customer): Ideally, we'd like to get to 4-hour RTO and 1-hour RPO. Right now we're probably looking at 24+ hours to fully recover from a major incident.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): Those are very reasonable targets. In terms of your applications, are these primarily legacy applications, or do you have any cloud-native applications already?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:35.000
John Smith (Customer): It's mostly legacy stuff. We have some .NET applications that are probably 8-10 years old, and several Java applications. We do have one newer microservices application that we built last year.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): Perfect. That gives us a good mix to work with. What's your timeline looking like for this migration? Is this something you want to complete this year?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:10.000
John Smith (Customer): We're hoping to have a decision by end of Q2, and ideally start the migration in Q3. The board is pushing for this after the outage, so we have executive support, which is good.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Mary Davis (Finance): I'm Mary Davis, CFO. From a budget perspective, we're looking at this as a 3-year investment. What kind of cost savings should we expect compared to our current datacenter costs?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): That's a great question, Mary. Typically we see 20-30% cost reduction in the first year, and even more as you optimize. But a lot depends on your current utilization and how we architect the cloud solution.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Mary Davis (Finance): Our current datacenter costs are running about $2.8 million annually, including staffing. If we could save even 25%, that's significant money we could reinvest in other initiatives.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): Absolutely. And beyond cost savings, you'll gain agility. The ability to spin up new environments for development and testing becomes much easier and faster.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:35.000
John Smith (Customer): That's actually a big pain point for us right now. Our developers are constantly waiting for infrastructure. Sometimes it takes weeks to get a new dev environment provisioned.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): With Infrastructure as Code, that becomes a matter of minutes instead of weeks. What are you currently using for monitoring and management of your infrastructure?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:05.000
John Smith (Customer): We're using SCOM for Windows monitoring and Nagios for Linux. It's... functional, but we don't have great visibility into application performance.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): That's very common. Cloud-native monitoring solutions give you much better application insights, with machine learning-based anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:40.000
John Smith (Customer): That sounds interesting. One concern I have is vendor lock-in. We've heard horror stories about companies getting locked into one cloud provider and then facing huge costs to migrate later.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): That's a very valid concern. We always recommend a multi-cloud strategy when possible, using containerization and cloud-agnostic services where it makes sense.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:10.000
John Smith (Customer): Speaking of containers, we've been looking at Kubernetes. Is that something you'd recommend for our legacy applications, or should we focus on lift-and-shift first?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): Great question. I'd recommend a phased approach. Start with lift-and-shift for the legacy apps to get immediate benefits, then modernize to containers over time. That microservices app you mentioned would be perfect for Kubernetes.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:45.000
John Smith (Customer): That makes sense. What about security? That's obviously a big concern for our board. How do we ensure we're not increasing our security risk by moving to the cloud?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): Security is actually often improved in the cloud. You get access to enterprise-grade security tools that would be expensive to implement on-premise. Plus, the cloud providers have dedicated security teams that are much larger than most internal teams.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Mary Davis (Finance): What about compliance? We're in the financial services sector, so we have pretty strict regulatory requirements.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): The major cloud providers all have extensive compliance certifications including SOC 2, PCI DSS, and others specific to financial services. We can help you design a compliant architecture from day one.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:50.000
John Smith (Customer): Excellent. So what would be the next steps if we wanted to move forward? We'd probably need some kind of assessment of our current environment.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): Absolutely. We'd start with a comprehensive discovery and assessment. This typically takes 2-3 weeks and gives us a detailed migration plan with timelines, costs, and risk assessments.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Mary Davis (Finance): What's the cost for that assessment? And would that cost be credited toward the implementation if we move forward?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): The assessment is typically $25,000, but yes, we do credit that full amount toward the implementation project if you decide to proceed with us.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:55.000
John Smith (Customer): That seems reasonable. Mary, can we budget for that assessment in Q1?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Mary Davis (Finance): Yes, I think we can make that work. I'd like to see a formal proposal though.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): Of course. I'll get you a detailed proposal by Friday. Mike, can you include some architecture diagrams showing the before and after state?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): Absolutely. I'll include a high-level migration roadmap as well, showing the phased approach we discussed.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:45.000
John Smith (Customer): Perfect. One last question - can you connect us with a reference customer? Ideally someone in financial services who's done a similar migration?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): Definitely. I have a great contact at First National Bank who completed a very similar migration last year. I'll reach out to them and set up a reference call.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:15.000
John Smith (Customer): Excellent. I think we have everything we need to move forward. Thanks everyone for your time today.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Sarah Jameson (Sales Engineer): Thank you, John and Mary. I'll follow up with the proposal and reference call details by end of week.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Charles Michaels (Solutions Architect): Looking forward to working with you both on this project.
